# SecureArms Toolkit v0.1

A peer-to-peer, CLI-first payment toolkit built for **Second Amendment-aligned businesses**, **freedom-respecting users**, and **resilient off-grid communities**.

SecureArms was created to defend the lawful right to transact in a world where payment networks are increasingly politicized. Designed with firearms retailers, training organizations, and privacy-minded individuals in mind, it provides a lightweight, self-hostable payment infrastructure free from gatekeepers, merchant category codes, or centralized throttling.

This v0.1 alpha release focuses on **modular CLI scaffolding** with minimal dependencies and maximum portability. Core functionality is stubbed and staged for phased implementation.
